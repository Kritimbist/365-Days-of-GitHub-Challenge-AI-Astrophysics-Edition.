# Array Manipulation
Creating NumPy arrays is a fundamental aspect of working with numerical data in Python.NumPy provides various methods to create arrays efficiently, catering to different needs and scenarios. 

NumPy provides several built-in functions to generate arrays with specific properties.

- np.zeros(): Creates an array filled with zeros.
- np.ones(): Creates an array filled with ones.
- np.full(): Creates an array filled with a specified value.
- np.arange(): Creates an array with values that are evenly spaced within a given range.
- np.linspace(): Creates an array with values that are evenly spaced over a specified interval.

## Simple Program of above function:
